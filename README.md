## Description

I create this app in order to provide a robust website backend for an e-commerce company. As e-commerce continues to grow as an industry, it is critical for a company to have a streamlined and effective website in order to remain competitive in the space. In the process of creating this app, I got valuable practice configuring an Express.js API to use Sequelize to perform CRUD operations on a database through the use of API routes.

## Installation

In order to use the app, the user will need both Node.js, MySQL2, Sequelize. [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) are instructions for installing Node. [Here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) are instructions for installing MySQL2. [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) are instructions for installing Sequelize.

## Usage

First, the user will create the database using the SQL commands in the db file. Next, they will seed the database by typing 'npm run seed' into their terminal. Then, they will enter 'node server.js' in the terminal to startup the server. Once the server is live, the user can use various GET routes to view category, product and tag data. They can use post routes to create categories, products or tags. They can use put routes to update categories, products or tags. They can use delete routes to delete categories, products or tags.
